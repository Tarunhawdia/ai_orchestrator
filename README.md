# Decentralized AI Agent Orchestration Platform

## Project Overview

Welcome to the **Decentralized AI Agent Orchestration Platform**! This ambitious open-source project aims to build a robust, scalable, and auditable platform for orchestrating collaborative AI agents. Leveraging Go for its high-performance backend and `langchaingo` for sophisticated AI agent capabilities, this platform will enable multiple intelligent agents to work together on complex tasks, share knowledge, and operate resiliently in a distributed environment.

This project is a deep dive into distributed systems, advanced AI architectures, robust networking, and modern DevOps/MLOps practices. We encourage contributions from developers interested in these cutting-edge fields.

## Vision and Goals

Our vision is to create a foundational layer for truly autonomous and collaborative AI. The platform will:

1.  **Orchestrate Complex Tasks:** Allow users to submit high-level goals that are automatically broken down and executed by a network of specialized AI agents.
2.  **Enable Agent Collaboration:** Facilitate seamless communication and knowledge sharing between diverse agents.
3.  **Ensure Resilience & Scalability:** Design a system that can operate reliably, scale efficiently, and recover from failures in a distributed setting.
4.  **Promote Transparency & Auditability:** Incorporate mechanisms for tracking agent actions and task progress, leveraging decentralized principles.
5.  **Foster Learning:** Serve as an excellent learning ground for Go, `langchaingo`, gRPC, message queues, Kubernetes, and MLOps.

## Getting Started (for Developers)

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- **Go:** Version 1.22 or higher ([https://go.dev/doc/install](https://go.dev/doc/install))
- **Docker:** For building and running containers ([https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/))
- **Git:** For version control ([https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git))
- **`make`:** (Usually pre-installed on Linux/macOS, for Windows, consider WSL or Chocolatey)

### Local Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Tarunhawdia/decentralized-ai-orchestrator.git](git@github.com:Tarunhawdia/ai_orchestrator.git)
    cd decentralized-ai-orchestrator
    ```

    _(Remember to replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username)_

2.  **Build the Orchestrator Service:**
    This command compiles the Go code for the orchestrator.

    ```bash
    make build
    ```

3.  **Run the Orchestrator Service Locally:**
    This will start the orchestrator service, listening on port `8080`.

    ```bash
    make run
    ```

    You should see output like: `Orchestrator Service starting on port 8080...`
    Open your browser to `http://localhost:8080` to see "Hello from the Orchestrator Service!".
    Press `Ctrl+C` in your terminal to stop the service.

4.  **Build and Run Orchestrator with Docker:**
    You can also run the service inside a Docker container.

    ```bash
    make docker-build
    make docker-run
    ```

    This will build the Docker image and then run it. Access it at `http://localhost:8080`.

5.  **Run Tests:**

    ```bash
    make test
    ```

    (Currently, there are no tests, but this command will be used extensively later.)

6.  **Clean Up:**
    Removes compiled binaries.
    `bash
    make clean
    `
